# Sliding Sign-In and Sign-Up Forms

These are sign in and sign up forms. I used some sliding effects from swup.js to swap between these two forms. You can click the "sign in" and "sign up" buttons on the webpages to see how the sliding effort works.

These are sign in and sign up forms that are inspired by [sefyudem](https://github.com/sefyudem/Sliding-Sign-In-Sign-Up-Form).
